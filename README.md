# PlantWall

This uses the Elixir OpenSCAD library to allow Elixir modules to define OpenSCAD models.

.scad and .stl files are in the [output](./output) directory.

.exs files are used to create the .scad files and are available in the [models](./models) directory.

The reusable components are modules in [lib/parts](./lib/parts)
